User Profile and Stats:
The Codewars dashboard prominently displays user information and statistics. For your quiz app, you could include:


Username and avatar
Member since date
Overall rank or level
Total quizzes completed
Highest score achieved
Favorite subjects or topics

To implement this:

Extend your User model to include these additional fields
Create a profile page that displays this information
Update these stats after each quiz attempt


Progress Tracking:
Codewars shows a progress bar for the current rank. For your quiz app, consider:


Overall progress towards a target score or rank
Progress in individual subjects or topics
A visual representation of improvement over time

Implementation:

Add fields to your QuizAttempt model to track progress
Create a function to calculate overall and subject-specific progress
Use a charting library like Chart.js to visualize progress


Honor System:
Codewars uses an honor system. You could adapt this concept:


Award "honor points" for completing quizzes, achieving high scores, or maintaining streaks
Create a leaderboard based on honor points
Offer badges or achievements for reaching certain honor levels

Implementation:

Add an 'honor' field to your User model
Create functions to award honor points based on quiz performance
Implement a badge system using a new model to track achievements


Language/Subject Breakdown:
Codewars shows language proficiency. Adapt this to show subject proficiency:


Display the number of quizzes completed in each subject
Show the highest score achieved in each subject
Indicate the user's strongest and weakest subjects

Implementation:

Modify your QuizAttempt model to better track subject-specific performance
Create queries to aggregate this data for display


Recent Activity:
Show recent quiz attempts and achievements:


List of recent quizzes taken with scores
Recent achievements or honor points gained
Streaks (consecutive days of taking quizzes)

Implementation:

Query recent QuizAttempt entries for the user
Implement a streak tracking system in your User model

Allow users to create and submit their own questions
